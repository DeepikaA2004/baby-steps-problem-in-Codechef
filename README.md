# baby-steps-problem-in-Codechef
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Chef is taking his baby steps into the world of programming.
The very first program he's tasked to write is as follows:
"Given two integers 
A and 
B, print 
+
A+B."

Unfortunately, Chef makes a typo: his program outputs 
×
A×B instead of 
+
A+B.

Given the values of 
A and
B, can you help Chef find the absolute difference between the correct answer and the value his program prints?

## Input Format
The only line of input will contain two space-separated integers, 
A and 
B.

## Output Format
Print a single integer: the difference between the correct answer and Chef's output.

Constraints
1<=A,B<=10

## Sample 1:  
## Input      Output
   4 7         17

Explanation:
The correct answer is 
4
+
7
=
11
4+7=11, but Chef's program prints 
4
×
7
=
28
4×7=28.
The difference between them is 
∣
28
−
11
∣
=
17
∣28−11∣=17.

Sample 2:
Input
Output
1 6
1
Explanation:
The correct answer is 
1
+
6
=
7
1+6=7, but Chef's program prints 
1
×
6
=
6
1×6=6.
The difference between these values is 
1
1.
